# Guardian Staking Process

## Staking through Web Wallet

Access the [Theta Web Wallet](https://wallet.thetatoken.org) from your desktop/laptop. Under the “Theta Wallet” logo, make sure “**Mainnet**: THETA mainnet (Default)” is selected, then unlock your Theta wallet using your typical access method (keystore, seed phrase, hardware wallet, etc.).

Once your wallet is unlocked, click the “**Stakes**” tab of the menu and click “**Deposit Stake**”, then click "**Guardian Node**".

In the **Guardian Node Holder (Summary)** field, enter the text string from your Guardian Node app. Enter the Amount of THETA you want to stake to this node and click “**Deposit Stake**". Note that you need to stake **at least 1,000 THETA**. Also, make sure you have at least 1 TFUEL in your wallet to pay for the transaction fee.

After reviewing your stake deposit info on the next screen, enter your wallet password, then click "**Confirm & Deposit Stake**". After the stake deposit transaction is confirmed, you can switch back to the Guardian node to [verify that it is working as expected](./GUI.md#verify-the-guardian-node).

**Important**: If you stake from a Nano Ledger wallet, you'd need to navigate to the Ethereum app, and make sure that in the settings, "Contract data Allowed" and "Debug data NOT Displayed" are selected.

## Staking through Mobile Wallet

**NOTE: The updated iOS/Android Theta Wallet versions have been submitted to the App Store/Play Store, but may take a few hours to be approved. Please wait until the latest wallets version v2.3 is available to stake from iOS/Android Theta Wallet.** 

Download the Theta Wallet app in the App Store / Play Store, or if already installed make sure  you have upgraded to version 2.0.0 (iOS) / 2.0.0 (Android).
